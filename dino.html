     <p>The dinosaurs that we know of and imagine may be completely wrong. New technology has allowed us to discover that some dinosaurs actually had feathers. According to <a href=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160330-legendary-dinosaurs-that-we-all-imagine-completely-wrong target="_blank">BBC</a>, the Velociraptor was found to have <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/317/5845/1721" target="_blank">quill knobs</a> on the forearm bones of a fossil. These knobs are where wing feathers anchor, and provide conclusive evidence for winged, bird-like Velociraptors. </p>

      <p>The question to ask here is: Do dinosaurs actually look like how we have imagined them? Or do they look more like the current animals that exist today?</p>
